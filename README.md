# CS304-CoPro

CoPro is going to streamline the process of matching student’s for the next homework assignment. Ideally, our main consumers would be professors in higher level education looking to randomly assign students to groups, while simultaneously ensuring partnerships/group-ships are feasible to each of the students. CoPro could also be used by students to find peers to work on their upcoming assignments with. In higher level courses, group work is often encouraged, but is not always easy because peers tend to gravitate towards people in class they feel most familiar with. Therefore, we want to build an application to combat this issue by encouraging diverse learning. Furthermore, CoPro would be useful because it would take into account a student’s skill level in a particular area, in addition to their availability. These features in particular allow for the application to successfully match students based on certain criteria that allow for successful partnerships/group-ships.
